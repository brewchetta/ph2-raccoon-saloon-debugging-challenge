# Phase 2 Raccoon Saloon Debugging Practice

A raccoon built this website but unfortunately for them their tiny paws often make mistakes on the keyboard. Your task is to go through the code already built and fix the mistakes they made using your React and debugging knowledge.

## Getting Started

To install:

```
npm install
npm run server
```

In a seperate terminal run:

```
npm run dev
```

## Endpoints

Your endpoint for the json-server is:

```
http://localhost:5555/raccoons
```

## Deliverables

Fix all the bugs! There are at least 18 bugs to be found. Your task isn't complete until everything has been tested and no error messages appear in the dev console.

You will only need to fix errors in these files (errors are estimates):

```
App.jsx ~4 Errors
RaccoonCard.jsx ~3 Errors
RaccoonForm.jsx ~8 Errors
RaccoonsContainer.jsx ~3 Errors
```

Good luck!
